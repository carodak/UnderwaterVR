# UnderwaterVR

The second virtual reality environment that I developed for my master's degree project in computer science (thesis). I can not put in the code since my project was in partnership with health institutes and companies.

I developped Underwater VR at the Heron Laboratory of the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research of the University of Montreal using C# with Unity3D. It is a therapeutic virtual experience designed to relax and unwind.

Participants follow an avatar walking through a savannah speaking in a soft and reassuring voice. As a way of attracting participantsâ€™ attention and reassuring them, the avatar asks users how they feel and gives clear and concise indications, both in writing and speaking, to ease information processing. The Windows-based environment that requires only a virtual reality headset and a mouse has been designed with cognitively impaired people in mind.
