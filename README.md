# UnderwaterVR

The second virtual reality environment that I developed for my master's degree project in computer science (thesis). I can not put in the code since my project was in partnership with health institutes and companies.

I developped Underwater VR at the Heron Laboratory of the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research of the University of Montreal using C# with Unity3D 2017.1.4. It is a therapeutic virtual experience designed to relax and unwind.

Participants follow an avatar walking through a savannah speaking in a soft and reassuring voice. As a way of attracting participantsâ€™ attention and reassuring them, the avatar asks users how they feel and gives clear and concise indications, both in writing and speaking, to ease information processing. The Windows-based environment that requires only a virtual reality headset and a mouse has been designed with cognitively impaired people in mind.

Note: My thesis project lasted about a year and a half and made me learn a lot about myself. I learned how to build my own structure and develop my planning skills. I validated my autonomy and my analytical skills. I also noticed my perfectionism, which sometimes led me to lose time and not be results-oriented enough. Since then, I learn every day to keep things simple, to "try" even if I do not have all the elements, and to make small prototypes. 
I try to loosen my grip because, as the Buddha shakyamuni says, "all conditioned things are of a nature to decay-strive on untiringly".
